## Overview

This document analyzes gaps between what **saas202513** currently provides for reporting/analytics and what's expected for a production SaaS product.

**Severity Definitions:**

|----------|-------------|
| **P0** | Critical for pilot/paid conversion - blocks revenue or causes data loss |
| **P1** | Important for production - significantly impacts user experience or operations |
| **P2** | Nice-to-have - improves experience but not blocking |

**Complexity Estimates:**

|------------|-------------|
| **S** | Small - <1 day, single file/component changes |
| **M** | Medium - 1-3 days, multiple files, may need new tables |
| **L** | Large - 3+ days, new services/pages, significant architecture |
